# Final Master's Work at VIU.


In this branch it is shown:
- Run models splitting the dataset into *training* and *test*, using the TensorFlow method *image_dataset_from_directory*.
- How to physically create train/validation/test sets persisted in disk. 

In branches **kfolds_validation** or **synthetic_data_application** there are more functions available to get outputs from the training, in cleaner notebooks.
