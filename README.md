# Final Master's Work at VIU.


<details>
  <summary>Main branch intro.</summary>
 This is a Computer Vision classification for Real State. The intention of this project is to improve the classification of different spaces inside houses. 

Consisting of:
- Fine-tuning of pre-trained models.
- Data augmentation.
    - TensorFlow method *ImageDataGenerator* in pickled data.
    - Adding data augmentation as a sequential layer using the TensorFlow method *image_dataset_from_directory*  straight from the pics folder.
- Study the creation of synthetic data.
</details>



----------------------------------

## Pickle_input branch:

- How to create a pickle from your input data and load it in memory as a whole.
- Advantages and disadvantages.
- Use of the *ImageDataGenerator* method.
