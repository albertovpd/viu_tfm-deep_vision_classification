    "- For all available data, it was shuffled and taken 150 pics of each class for the test set.\n",
    "- The remaining pics were at first shuffled again, and then distributed in train/validation folders (80-20%).\n",

    "- The same 150 pics are taken for the test set.\n",
    "- The same train/validation distribution (80-20%) is taken.\n",
    "- 50 synth pics of each class are randomly chosen, added to the real ones to create the folder *\"synth50_train_val_ds\"*. The same process is repeated with 250 and 480 synth pics."
